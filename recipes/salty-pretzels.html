  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Soft pretzels are a delicious and classic snack that originated in Germany. These soft, chewy, and slightly salty
    pretzels are perfect for snacking or for serving at parties. With just a few simple ingredients, you can make these
    pretzels in the comfort of your own home. Serve them warm with mustard or cheese sauce for dipping.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>2 tsp active dry yeast</li>
    <li>4 1/2 to 5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>4 cups water</li>
    <li>1/2 cup baking soda</li>
    <li>Coarse salt, for sprinkling</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <p>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes until the mixture
      becomes foamy.</li>
    <li>Add 4 1/2 cups of flour and salt to the yeast mixture and stir until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky,
      add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it forms a smooth ball.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough for about 5 minutes on a floured surface.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Let the dough rise in a warm place for about 30
      minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a large pot, bring the 4 cups of water and baking soda to a boil.</li>
    <li>Roll the dough into long ropes, about 1 inch in diameter. Shape into pretzels.</li>
    <li>Boil each pretzel in the baking soda mixture for 30 seconds on each side.</li>
    <li>Place the pretzels on the prepared baking sheet. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with coarse salt.</li>
    <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
    <li>Serve warm with mustard or cheese sauce for dipping. Enjoy!</li>
