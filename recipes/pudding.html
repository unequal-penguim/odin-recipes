  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3 tbsp cornstarch</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
    <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <p>
  <ol>
    <li>In a medium saucepan, whisk together the milk, sugar, cornstarch, and salt.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks.</li>
    <li>Slowly pour some of the milk mixture into the egg yolks while whisking continuously to temper the eggs.</li>
    <li>Pour the tempered egg yolks back into the saucepan with the remaining milk mixture.</li>
    <li>Cook over medium heat, whisking continuously, until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil, about 5-7 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Remove from heat and stir in the butter and vanilla extract until the butter has melted and the mixture is
      smooth.</li>
    <li>Pour the pudding into a bowl or individual serving dishes and cover with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto
      the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming.</li>
    <li>Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or until set.</li>
    <li>Serve chilled, topped with fresh fruit, whipped cream, or any other desired toppings. Enjoy!</li>
